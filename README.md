# Statistical_Inference-_Simulation_n_Inferential_Data_Analysis
In this project, based on the *mtcars* dataset (from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine) we are interested in the comprehension of the relationships between dataset's cars' fuel consumption and a set of variables, trying, in particular, to model and quantify the one between the consumption and the car's transimission type.
