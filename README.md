## Statistical Inference (Skills Demo Project): Simulation & Inferential Data Analysis
The project consists of two parts:

1. A simulation exercise.
In this report we’re investigating the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem,

2. Basic inferential data analysis.
In this report we’re analyzing the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

The project was carried out as a final (peer-reviewed) assignment  within the Coursera course [Statistical Inference](http://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inference) of the [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization](http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) in September 2019
